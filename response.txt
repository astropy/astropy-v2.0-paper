We thank the referee for bringing up this important point. After some discussion
within the Astropy community, it became clear that a section regarding inclusion 
is beyond the scope of the current paper. Quantitative analysis of the Astropy 
community demographics is warranted. However, this is a serious undertaking 
beyond the capabilities of our community, and it may require IRB approval. Based 
on the referee's comment, we have established initial contact with the NumFOCUS 
Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) program. Results will not 
be available in time for this paper. We have opted to remove "inclusive" from 
the paper title to make room for future study and dialogue.

> The phase 'open development' is used a few times but isn't really defined or

> A number of times I found myself wondering how the Astropy projects decides 
> whether to build their own package or leverage something available in the

> made by the Astropy project to build a new core package only increases the 
> long term cost/overhead of maintaining this functionality. For example, 
> Section 3.5.2 describes `astropy.table` and notes that there's similarities 
> to the pandas package and numpy arrays. The functionality described in 
> `astropy.nddata` also sounds somewhat generic. Some discussion as to why 
> existing community tools (such as pandas) weren't used would be very welcome. 
> In addition, if the answer to this question is that these other tools don't 
> support all of the functionality the Astropy community needs (e.g. ability to
> handle Quantities with units in tables) are any efforts being made by the 
> Astropy community to contribute these changes to packages such as Pandas?

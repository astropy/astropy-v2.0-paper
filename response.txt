We thank the referee for bringing up this important point. After some discussion
within the Astropy community, it became clear that a section regarding inclusion 
is beyond the scope of the current paper. Quantitative analysis of the Astropy 
community demographics is warranted. However, this is a serious undertaking 
beyond the capabilities of our community, and it may require IRB approval. Based 
on the referee's comment, we have established initial contact with the NumFOCUS 
Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) program. Results will not 
be available in time for this paper. We have opted to remove "inclusive" from 
the paper title to make room for future study and dialogue.

This question is at the intersection of two communities. On the one
side, there is the open source community, which by itself consists of
many different projects with vastly different norms and
processes. Many terms, "open develoment" being one of them, are used
with slightly different meanings in different parts of this
community. The model of astropy - the development happens openly on
github and anyone with an internet connection can comment on issues or
propose a pull request, but only a select set of maintainers can merge
them - is by no means special. Many open source communities work in a
very similar way, although they may use different terminology to
describe it. On the other hand, there is the astrophysics community,
and while there are several open source and open development (in the
way astropy uses the term) projects in astronomy, astropy is probably
the biggest one. Many astronmers are not involved in any open
development (also many make use of open source projects they are not
involved in e.g. GNU/Linux), and the concept is new to many of
them. This article caters mostly to the astrophysics community, so we
decided to add a definition, but we refrain from a comparative
discussion with other open source projects.

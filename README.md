Scope of the Paper
==================

The goal is to produce a brief and informative paper that covers major
astropy principles not mentioned in the first paper, the core v2.0
package, and infrastructure in the astropy project to support development
in python.

The draft of the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/astropy/astropy-v2.0-paper/blob/master-pdf/main.pdf).

Notes on writing
================

*  We don't plan on including code in this paper, but if you think you
        will need to include code in your section, please add it to a separate
        python module (.py file) and include it in this repository.
*  Use `\sectionname` not ``Section``, `\figurename`
        not ``Figure``
*  Use `\astropypkg` for the astropy package,
   `\astropy` for the astropy project, `\python` not
        ``Python``
*  If your subpackage was included in Paper I, then please just include a
   note on what the package does, a reference to paper I, and any new major
   updates to your package
*  If your subpackage was not included, then please describe the
   subpackage on level with what was in the first paper, and highlight any
   major features in it. Typical length should be equivalent to one page
   (single-column).
